Bubble Sort Algorithm implemented in Java. This Algorithm is the simplest algorithm if you want to get into sorting algorithms.

Each run through the list, from start to finish, is known as a pass. The bubble sort continues until a pass is made where no values have been swapped. At this point, the list is sorted. After the first pass, the last index is sorted and this algorithm just keeps on sorting indices from the end hence its name, bubble sort.

It's time complexities are:
1. Worst-Case: O(n^2)
2. Average-Case: O(n^2)
3. Best-Case: O(n)
And it's space complexity is 1.
