Insertion sort is more efficient than bubble sort.

An insertion sort compares values in turn, starting with the second value in the list as it treats the first as already sorted. 
If this value is greater than the value to the left of it, no changes are made. 
Otherwise this value is repeatedly moved left until it meets a value that is less than it. 
The sort process then starts again with the next value. This continues until the end of the list is reached.

Worst Case: O(n^2). Avg case: O(n^2). Best Case: O(n)
