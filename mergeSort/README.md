Merge Sort keeps on dividing an array until there is only one element left after which it compares, puts the element in the right spot, and merges. This
technique is called divide and conquer.
Merge Sort's best, average and worst case are the same at nlogn.

Merge Sort is a very efficient algorithm but a bit difficult to understand.
