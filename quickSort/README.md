Quicksort works by choosing a pivot and storing every number greater than the pivot on the right of the array and every number lesser than it on the left hand side.
This is the same principle that merge sort uses which is called divide and conquer.

It's a pretty good algorithm with best and avg case of: nlogn and Worst case of: O(N^2)

While quicksort is faster than mergesort most of the time, it is not stable and that is the biggest downside to this algorithm.
